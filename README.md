Enable lenovo s10-3c's keyboard on FreeBSD /Linux


The bios of Lenovo netbook s10-3c is weird, so, after i installed linux or freebsd on it, the keyboard just DOESN'T work.
Solutions are below.

### 1. make sure you have gcc in your system
if not ,try these:
on FreeBSD,
    # pkg install gcc
on Ubuntu/Debian,
    # apt-get install gcc
on openSUSE.
    # zypper in gcc
